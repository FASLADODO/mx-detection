Notes:<br>
RFCN trained on VOC is reported as mAP@IoU=0.5 according to VOC Metric, and it is slightly different from mAP @IoU=0.5 of COCO.

MS means the model is using multi-scaling when training.

FPN(MS) and RFCN are bought from <https://github.com/msracver/Deformable-ConvNets> and rewritten by new Gluon API,
their performance should be same with the model from <https://github.com/msracver/Deformable-ConvNets>.
